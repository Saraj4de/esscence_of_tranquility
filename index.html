          <p class="important">As an adult we have forgotten how to tap into our inner child because life get so so serious and harsh.. 
             I reckon we all still secretly want to be curios of "oh I wonder what it's like to just go venture to forrest,seasside,the nothern lights.." 
            Or "Oh, I just want to scream , shout, dance in the middle of a crowd of people and be silly for just that tiny bit of moment, or give someone a sponteous hug of love" 
            we shamefully hush hush those childish games and throw them to the side because we are scare people will judge us , laugh at us or think we are weird.. Or throughout childhood
            we've be punish for embarrasing teachers, parents, other friends in highschool and we end up aborbing their embas=rrasment as our own.. so we don't show our indiviuality as it's seen as shameful and bad.</p>

            
            <p>We also push down the ideas of ever chasing our dreams as it isn't a "real job" -- "Oh I'd love to be a performer, write a book,travel the world"
            and carry on with the same tasteless routines, career/job, paying bills we hate it but it's fimilar -- It is a very painful and we don't even know it. We are scare of uncertainty,
            we see as costly to e.g. go on a sponetous holiday or ask that person out or make a new friend because we self reject as it hurts less-- </p>
            
            <p> tell you I've been fighting these same tedious beleifs all my life - But, learning to break those patterns by facing my fears and I see-- Wait, 
            I can e.g. see a chiraprator - she doesn't hurt me I feel awesome, or do a few stand up gigs via open mic - not as scary as I thought it woukd be-- these people
            are supportive or even isolated myself fir years on end thinking I wouldn't survive without X friend, family member but I got proven wrong.. learnt to rely on me and see , wait, I can 
            e.g. pay the bills, make a new life, try new things alone- go to cinema, resutruants, travel without anyone and turns out I'm okay.. </p>
            
            
           <p> All in all, We stay stuck in our prison of liimted beielfs of " I can't do this and that" or "I'm too old or not strong enough or have no money" to feel same and certain.In the end,nothing is certain
            no one stays in lur life firever, that certain job could end due to company shut down, house/flat maybe landlord decides to buy it off and we got to move out-- 
            We din't trust oursevels to let go of control and believe wait.. What if I just try that class tonight see how it goes.. Bam made a new friend -- 
            Maybe, you have a beilf of "no one likes me or I'm boring"-- So, we keep to our own self isolating routine and don't bother to try make new friends, or new class as it's too painful to 
            face-- Trust me I see your pain deeply. It make sense why we beileve what we believe, these exprience's from past event was very painful.. but, we don't give oursevel
            chance's to try X new place, food or trip as we think everything will crash around us. But, you see no matter what everything ends, crashes down anyway.. may aswell persue what is exciting you--</p>
            GIVE YOURSELF A CHANCE AND TRY
            Psychologist have said it takes 30 days to make a new habit.. imagine the ebefnots of baby stepping eahc day and try a new thing.. imagine what you can do</p> 
           
             What if I told you , you can? This page is to show off all those inner childhood screams that we've repressed to come play
              If you'd like a place of safety, aliveness, fun, sponetous feelings -- you've come to the right place- 
            We don't have to be perfect, we can just be-- we can connect to our inner child and be free... </p>
